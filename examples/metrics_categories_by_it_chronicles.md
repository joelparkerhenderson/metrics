## Efficiency & Effectiveness

Traditionally these metrics referred to the conventional measurement of development capacity and operational capabilities; for instance, looking at server to admin ratios.

However, more recently, there’s been a shift in focus to incorporate more customer-centric ratios as well, such as FTEs to customers.


## Velocity

Accelerating application delivery is one of the key drivers of successful DevOps. Tracking velocity shows whether you are improving application delivery by underscoring IT’s responsiveness to increasing business demand.

These metrics will indicate how well the IT organization has been able to embrace automation and eliminate manual or isolated tasks in order to increase their time to market significantly.


## Quality

According to Puppet’s 2017 State of DevOps report, the pressure to deploy faster and more frequently causes lower IT performers to pay “insufficient attention to building in quality.”

On the other hand, high performers know that they don’t have to sacrifice speed for stability. They understand that quality has become a shared responsibility of all players in the software delivery lifecycle and that quality should be built into the software earlier in the development process.


## Culture, Collaboration, and Sharing

The importance of communication, collaboration and integration between development and operations can’t be stressed enough when it comes to DevOps. Just having the right processes and technology alone isn’t good enough. Incorporating metrics focused on the people aspect of the organization provides a good barometer of acceptance or resistance to DevOps.

This shift in approach is critical to adopting an agile, continuous delivery and deployment process because it requires Operations to get involved earlier in the lifecycle and Dev to focus more on application support.
