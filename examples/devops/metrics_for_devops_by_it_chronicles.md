## Frequency of deployment

Boosting deployment frequency has been a powerful motivator for shifts in development practices. The ability to make code changes quickly and easily is provides a key competitive advantage for any company that needs to deliver new features quickly to customers and respond to their changing needs.

Did you know that the highest-performing IT organizations deploy more applications more frequently, such as multiple deployments per day compared to between once a month and once every six months for lower performing IT organizations? More frequent deployments reduce the probability of disruption resulting from more complex and infrequent deployments.


## Deployment Speed

This measures how long it takes for a single deployment to go from commit to code that’s successfully running in production. While it takes high performing organizations less than one hour, it can take between one and six months for low IT performing organizations. Low performers are likely not automating nor standardizing their job definitions leading to wasted time in production, hard to fix errors and unplanned work, all because of poor communication and manual intervention.

High performers spend 50% less time on unnecessary rework than low and medium performers. This allows them to dramatically increase revenue by using that extra time to develop more value-added services.


## Failure Rates

It’s great to deploy more frequently and quickly, but if changes fail just as frequently, you’ve gained nothing. The average cost of critical application failure is between $500K to $1M per hour and failed deployments can take services down, resulting in lost revenue and frustrated customers.

## Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) 

Mean Time to Recovery is an important performance metric that refers to the average time that a device takes to recover from any failure. MTTR underscores key business outcomes that directly relate to customer experience, customer acquisition, and retention. Here are some important questions to answer when it comes to measuring MTTR:

* Were the users able to access your IT services?

* Did the customers experience application errors?

* Did users abandon the application before completion?

* What is your customer satisfaction rating?

Once DevOps has a better grip on where its capabilities stand today it can focus on shortening recovery time. The goal is to improve MTTR dramatically in order to reduce costs and accelerate application delivery.  


## Measuring Culture

Focusing on culture must be an intrinsic part of any DevOps process. What are the key components in fostering a collaborative environment between Dev and Ops? To thrive within a DevOps ecosystem, the team must be supported by:

* A culture that encourages innovation that focuses on integrating lean principles and shorter implementation cycles.

* A structure that removes organizational silos thus empowering strategic alignment and reducing conflict.

* A culture of high mutual trust. This is a key requirement to ensure that Dev and Ops can accomplish incredible things – together as one cohesive DevOps effort. One way to do this is to designate a “Transformational Leader” who has the characteristics to contribute to such progressive momentum.

When it comes to measuring these outcomes, you can look at the following metrics: employee morale, retention rates, and responsiveness to change within the organization.
